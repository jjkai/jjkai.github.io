        <h2>Hi, I am <strong>Jia-Kai Chou</strong></h2>
        <p>A Researcher in <strong>Information Visualization &amp; Visual Analytics</strong></p>
    </header>
        <p>I design and develop interactive systems that incorporate both data science and visualization capabilities to perform effective data analytics. To assess the effectiveness of my designs, I employ user-centered design principles for both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. My work involves close collaboration with researchers from diverse fields such as sociology, healthcare, neuroscience, and cell biology, and helps address research questions in their fields. I also focus on the privacy preserving aspect of user information while sharing, processing, and gaining insights from the data.</p>
